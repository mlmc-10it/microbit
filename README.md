# The Compass
Note that the magnetometer needs to be calibrated before use. This is done by tipping the micro:bit around to draw a circle on the LEDs. Be aware that sometimes the magnetometer calibration can be affected by the magnetic fields emanating from an electronic device, such as a computer.

Follow the instructions on this page to learn about the magnetometer, - http://microbit-challenges.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/compass.html 

# Challenge
Make your microbit display the letters "N', "E", "S" and "W" when the microbit is pointing North, East, South and West respectively.
